## Why do we go non-linear?

- In choosing our $\hat{f}$ we need to look at our data to understand what sort of options are logical. 

- In the cases we had yesterday, we had data that appeared to be linearly related, therefore linear regression was a great option.

- Today we will explore a common case when linearity does not apply. Often researchers will have an outcome variable that is binary. This means the outcome is either $0$ or $1$.This usually is found in cases of whether an event did or did not happen.

- What are some examples of this? If a person voted, they would have a $1$, and if a person did not vote, they would have a $0$.

## Logit Link Function

Here is the function. Yikes! Seems intimidating right?

$$
  P(Y_i = 1|\, x_i) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}}{1+e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}} = \pi_i
$$

- The important points to note are that the probability that $Y_i = 1$ given the observed value (input) of $x_i$ is called $\pi_i$. 

- Because our $\beta$'s are run through this *link function* they are not directly interpretable in the same way linear regression $\beta$'s.

- We interpret logged odds instead, which are the odds of
