## GGplot: What is it?

- Package for creating visualizations based on the "Grammar of Graphics"
- Part of the tidyverse

## GGplot Basic Intuition

It is a three part process that includes:

- Specifying Data
- Mapping Aesthetics
- Adding a Geometric Layer

## Titanic Data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
glimpse(penguins)
```

## Step 1 

Add your data layer.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins)
```

## Step 2

Add an aesthetic layer. We are adding an x-axis here. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = species))
```

## Step 3 

Add your geometric layer. We are creating a bar plot for the different penguin species! NOTE! The geometric layer is outside of the parenthesis. It is added outside with an addition sign.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = species)) + 
        geom_bar()
```
